- the general idea was to replicate Spotify, didn't really work out but at least it's functional(-ish)!
- I like this song a lot, I listened to it on repeat while writing this code
- the css animation for the progress bar is `ease` and could be found in `styles.css`

```css
.progress {
    animation: loader 212s ease;
    background: #1db954;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 5px;
    width: 0;
}
```

- obviously, I am too lazy to figure out how to actually write a media player please forgive me
